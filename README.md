# Knowledge Graphs for goals models generation

We provide the code used to produce the analyses of our paper: *Leveraging knowledge graphs for goal model generation*. The code can be run in a dedicated Jupyter Notebook:

## Installing the dependencies

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the generation of texts to help produce new subgoals

```shell
jupyter notebook approach_demo.ipynb
```
